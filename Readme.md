## What I learnt from this Project:

- Created first for the small screen then created for larger screen.
- Using the background image from the original website by copying it's URL from the inspect section.
- Using a sticky navbar
- Took lot of time to get the display shown on fourth picture right: 
   - keep the gap between different pictures same changing only at breakpoints
   - Similarly keeping the size of the picture constant
   - How to fix the text on the picture
   - Figuring out which element should be assigned position:relative so as to place the text
- First time using grid; experienced benefits of using grid over flexbox.
- First project where I used breakpoints

## Time taken:
 Took around 5 days to complete this.
